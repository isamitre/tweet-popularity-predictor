# tweet-popularity-predictor

## Problem: What problem are we trying to solve?
The problem we are trying to solve is how well received a tweet, or an ad created by advertisers, would be to the general public.

## Motivation: Why is this a problem? 
Online marketing has now become absolutely essential for a company's growth. On top of this, because of how much content is posted everyday, the advertisement must not only be direct, but it must be well received to go “viral.” 
Instead of wasting resources to determine whether an advertisement tweet would be well liked or not, our program would simply be able to give companies a metric on how good, or bad, their idea is.

## Features Implemented
You can enter any tweet you want, so there is no limit to what you want to test as popular or not. 
You can choose how you want your information processed: with a Hash Table or Red Black Tree. After pressing the button of your choice, you then have to wait until a new screen pops up. This new screen will first offer you how long it took for your answer to be found in seconds, allowing you to compare whether a Hash Table or Red Black tree was faster.
You can see your tweet’s popularity score. A 4 is the best score, a 2 is a neutral score, and a 0 is the worst score. 
You can see which words in your tweet were the most influential to the tweet’s overall popularity score. If you have over a 2, then it will show you the most positively influential words. If you have under a 2, then it will show you the most negatively influential words. 
The program offers a visual to understand the score, and allows you a “Try Again” function which will display the starting window again and allow the user to enter another tweet and perform their desired calculations.
